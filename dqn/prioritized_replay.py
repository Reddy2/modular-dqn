###### The below (and remaining text) are notes on the algorithm implementation and some commented out tests #####

## Notes on algorithm implementation:
## Two paragraphs from the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf TODO: Put in name of paper

## For the rank-based variant, we can approximate the cumulative density function with a piecewise
## linear function with k segments of equal probability. The segment boundaries can be precomputed
## (they change only when N or Î± change). At runtime, we sample a segment, and then sample uniformly
## among the transitions within it. This works particularly well in conjunction with a minibatchbased
## learning algorithm: choose k to be the size of the minibatch, and sample exactly one transition
## from each segment â this is a form of stratified sampling that has the added advantage of balancing
## out the minibatch (there will always be exactly one transition with high magnitude Î´, one with
## medium magnitude, etc).

## Our final
## solution was to store transitions in a priority queue implemented with an array-based binary heap.
## The heap array was then directly used as an approximation of a sorted array, which is infrequently
## sorted once every 10^6
## steps to prevent the heap becoming too unbalanced. This is an unconventional
## use of a binary heap, however our tests on smaller environments showed learning was unaffected
## compared to using a perfectly sorted array. This is likely due to the last-seen TD-error only being a
## proxy for the usefulness of a transition and our use of stochastic prioritized sampling. A small improvement
## in running time came from avoiding excessive recalculation of partitions for the sampling
## distribution. We reused the same partition for values of N that are close together and by updating
## Î± and Î² infrequently. Our final implementation for rank-based prioritization produced an additional
## 2%-4% increase in running time and negligible additional memory usage. This could be reduced
## further in a number of ways, e.g. with a more efficient heap implementation, but it was good enough
## for our experiments.

# Understanding the first paragraph: TODO: Perhaps put this right under the first paragraph

## The CDF can be used with a uniform distribution for sampling from a discrete "pdf"
# For example: X can be {1, 2, 3}.  P(X = x) = [0.1, 0.4, 0.5]  (i.e. P(X = 2) = 0.4)
# We sample from a uniform distribution u = U[0, 1]
# We then use the CDF and u to sample from our discrete distribution:
# if u < 0.1: return 1
# if u < 0.1 + 0.4: return 2
# if u < 0.1 + 0.4 + 0.5: return 3
# Note: The CDF is P(X < x) =  [0.1, 0.1 + 0.4, 0.1 + 0.4 + 0.5] = [0.1, 0.5, 1]

# "we can approximate the cumulative density function with a piecewise
# linear function with k segments of equal probability"

# seems to mean the following:
# Take k segments, so each has equal probability 1 / k
# Let's say k = 3, so we get 1/3
# Then the cdf is [1/3, 2/3, 3/3]
# So there is a (horizontal) line with value 1/3, which jumps to 2/3, and then jumps to 1

# So we build a priority queue and put the priorities in there
# We sample from the priority queue using the CDF technique above
# Every once in a while we sort the priority queue


# Notes on rank-based implementation:
# The maximum weight will be the weight with the smallest probability
# The lowest probability will be the experience with the smallest priority
# The smallest priority will be 1 / max_rank = 1 / N

# Since only P(i) changes, the maximum weight is the one with the smallest P(i), min_i(P(i))
# w_i = (N * P(i))^(-beta)
# w_j = (N * P(j))^(-beta) / max_i(w_i)   # TODO: This is recursive and makes no sense !!!!!
# i is over the weights we have seen so far, N is the size of the priority queue's current size (NOT its capacity)
# TODO: If we precompute then N may be the size of the precomputed "N" !!

# min_prob = probabilities[-1] # Since the probabilties are done by 1 / rank(i) => min = 1 / rank(N)
